Removes the "Try Gutenberg" panel from the WP-Admin Dashboard, introduced in WordPress 4.9.5 Beta 1. We only want to try Gutenberg once it's ready. Not now.


## Features & Description:

This one-liner plugin does only one thing: remove the "Try Gutenberg" Dashboard Panel within WP-Admin which was introduced with WordPress version 4.9.5 Beta 1.

Gutenberg as of now is confusing for clients. Also, the "product" is not ready yet (far from it), so why should you even try it now? We don't want that. Make it ready and useable, then we might consider trying it out.

So, for now, just install and activate this plugin and you're done ;-)
